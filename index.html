  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>
    Here I am going to upload every single thing that I learn about web development.
    I will try using JavaScript sometimes, but mostly I will focus on HTML and CSS.
    Please note that I love what I am doing and most of this text is just some filler
    to make this article look fancier.<br><br>
    I love this coding stuff and the fact that I can have my own domain by using GitHub.
    Sadly it's just frontend because database hosting would be so much space to give away for free.
    Also I'd love to say that I'm open to receive feedback and suggestions, I'd love to fill this page
    with as much stuff as possible.
  </p>

  <h1>Info</h1>
  <p>
    This stylesheet is partially made with AI. Still, most of HTML works are on me.
    Well, down below I'll give you answers to some questions that you might have in your head.
    Even if you didn't have a question, it's alright, I just need some text to fill up the page
    so the footer works normally.
  </p>
  <div id="faq">
  <h2>&gt; Why am I doing this?</h2>
  <p>
    I need a place to show my works on frontend development. I thought there wasn't a way to have a free domain.
    But guess what? GitHub offers frontend hosting. Sadly tho, no backend, which means no databases,
    which means that I can't work on some projects that I had in mind. Still, frontend dev is way better than nothing.
  </p>

  <h2>&gt; Who am I?</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Carlos, I am from Colombia. More information is reserved to
    <a href="about.html">this page</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>&gt; Will you add more stuff?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, I will try to add more code to my website, but I won't do too much on school days. Maybe on weekends.
  </p>

  <h2>&gt; This whole website process started as a hobby?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, all of this started as a hobby, but some-way-I-wonder-how-happened, for the years 2026-27 I'll be studying web-dev on SENA.
